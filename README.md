## Introduction

Predicting stock prices is a challenging and uncertain task. This project showcases a basic implementation of using a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock prices. The model takes a sequence of previous stock prices as input and predicts the next price.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
   cd stock-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
   ```

3. Prepare your dataset:
   - Place your historical stock price data in CSV format in the project directory as `data.csv`.
   - Ensure the CSV file contains a 'Date' column and a 'Close' price column.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have placed the required dataset as described in the Getting Started section.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```
   python stock_prediction.py
   ```

3. The script will preprocess the data, train the stacked LSTM model, and generate predictions.

4. The script will also display a visualization of the actual stock prices and the predicted prices.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```
